                    <h2>Task description</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this task, you're going to play a dice game, but
                        first you must prepare for an overwhelming victory. The
                        game itself is very simple. Both players roll a single
                        die and whoever rolls highest scores a point. (On a
                        tie, both players must reroll until someone scores.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These aren't standard dice however. Each player can put
                        any positive number on any side of the die as long as
                        the number of sides match and the total of all the
                        chosen numbers are the same. For example, one player
                        might use a six sided die with the numbers [3, 3, 3, 3,
                        6, 6] while the other player uses a six sided die with
                        the numbers [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]. The interesting part of
                        this game is that even with the same number of sides
                        and the same total, different dice have different
                        chances of winning. Using the example die, the player
                        with all 4's will win 2/3 of the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To prepare for this game, you're investigating
                        different ways of picking the numbers. To do this,
                        write a program that will take an opponent's die and
                        output some die which will win against it more than
                        half the time. If no die satisfies the task
                        requirements, return an empty string.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Input</h3>
                    <p>
                        Comma separated numbers representing opponent's die as
                        a first command line argument of your program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>
                            $ &lt;your_program&gt; 3,3,3,3,6,6
                        </code>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Output</h3>
                    <p>
                        Print your solution to <code>stdout</code> also as
                        comma separated values. If solution for given input
                        doesn't exist, print empty string.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Scoring</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your submission will be scored in 3 categories: time,
                        memory usage and tokens. Tokens represent the lenght of
                        your script in meaningful units of code (i.e. making
                        the variable and function names shorter won't help, but
                        using less variables and functions will).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your program will be tested by several performance
                        tests judging it in terms of time and memory. Each test
                        will be rerun several times and the values will be
                        averaged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Be warned that each test has to finish within 60
                        seconds on our testing laptop (Intel Core i7 with 4
                        cores, 12GB RAM, Fedora 27). If your program takes longer, it will
                        be terminated and marked as timeouted.
                    </p>

                            Your solution must include the standard C main
                            method, that is a method with the following
                            signature:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>
                                int main(int argc, char *argv[])
                            </code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will use this method as the entry point to your
                            submitted solution, using a command such as this:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>
                                $ ./solution 1,2,3,4,5,6
                            </code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your solution must not print anything to the
                            standard output, other than the final
                            computation result.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                        <p>
                            You're going to need an implementation of Java SE
                            9, preferably OpenJDK 9. If you're using Linux,
                            just install the package. If you're using Windows,
                            go fish.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Submitting your solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            You must submit your solution in the form of Java
                            source code. This source code must be placed in one
                            and only one file with a name of your choosing.
                            Your solution must compile using the following
                            command, without any extra dependencies:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <code>
                                $ javac YourSolutionFile.java
                            </code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your solution must include the standard Java main
                            method, that is a method with the following
                            signature:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <code>
                                public static void main(final String... args)
                            </code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will use this method as the entry point to your
                            submitted solution, using a command such as this:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>
                                $ java YourSolutionFile 1,2,3,4,5,6
                            </code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your solution must not print anything to the
                            standard output, other than the final
                            computation result.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Specifics of the JVM we're using</h3>
                        <p>
                            To run your code, we will be using the following
                            JRE:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <code>
                                openjdk version "9.0.1"
                            </code><br/>
                            <code>
                                OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 9.0.1+11)
                            </code><br/>
                            <code>
                                OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 9.0.1+11, mixed mode)
                            </code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will be limiting the memory
                            allocation pool to 32 megabytes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The final command we will use to run your
                            submission will therefore be:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <code>
                                $ java -Xms32m -Xmx32m YourSolutionFile 1,2,3,4,5,6
                            </code>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are aware of the fact that this JVM
                            configuration may make several non-deterministic
                            performance optimizations which may give unfair
                            advantage to different solutions running in
                            different JVM instances. To offset this, we will be
                            executing each submission multiple times and the
                            resulting score will be based on an average of the
                            individual execution times.
